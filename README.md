# Dronekit

Dronekit is a library with my scripts containing a code for my drones. I'm using python-dronekit and python-picamera for aerial photography as I use Raspberry Pi 4 as a companion computer. I'll be happy if this can help someone and I'm looking forward to any sugestions of how to improve this repository.
