# Dronekit

Scripts used for my home-made drone.

## Getting Started

This repository includes few template scripts for my drone. There are 2 simple scripts for testing connection and for takeoff and landing just to clarify that everything is ok. Other 2 scripts are used when drone is in "GUIDED" or "AUTO" mode. Scripts are used as a template, you can change coordinates or velocities for each flight, depending of what you want from the flight.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### Description

DroneKit-Python 2.x helps you create powerful apps for UAVs. These apps run on a UAV’s Companion Computer, and augment the autopilot by performing tasks that are both computationally intensive and require a low-latency link (e.g. computer vision).  Onboard apps can significantly enhance the autopilot, adding greater intelligence to vehicle behaviour, and performing tasks that are computationally intensive or time-sensitive (for example, computer vision, path planning, or 3D modelling). DroneKit-Python can also be used for ground station apps, communicating with vehicles over a higher latency RF-link. The API communicates with vehicles over MAVLink. It provides programmatic access to a connected vehicle’s telemetry, state and parameter information, and enables both mission management and direct control over vehicle movement and operations.
