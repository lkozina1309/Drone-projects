# Dronekit

Dronekit is a library with my scripts containing a code for my drones. 

There are 2 simple simple scripts, just for testing connection, takeoff and landing and 2 template scripts I use to choose certain functions and coordinates to make useful scripts.  

I'll be happy if this can help someone and I'm looking forward to any suggestions of how to improve this repository.
